Like the year before, I am co-organizer of the [6th Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for the Many-core Era (ROME 2018)](http://wrome.github.io/vancouver2018/), which is held in conjunction with [IPDPS 2018](http://www.ipdps.org) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
I hope that workshop will be as successful as the last one.
